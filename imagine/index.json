What we are really doing is teaching people to see. That’s the important function. That’s why I think it is tragic when school funding gets cut, they cut out the art. To be creative, we must choose something that is really hard, that we might fail at, and have failed at; then we’re more likely to come up with something that is fresh and different.”\n\n— Ed Catmull, Pixar, [Creativity, Inc.](https://medium.com/imaginaxiom/art-science-7f076db69e12)\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZrjusPeOZRk\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"}
