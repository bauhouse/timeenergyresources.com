## Join a movement to build a world we want to live in

Building the kind of world that we want to live in is going to take all of us working together to rediscover our common humanity.

Of course, there is nothing more fun than finding meaning, purpose, and agency doing something that makes the world a better place, all while spending time with people who will challenge, inspire, and mentor you, and maybe even become your close circle of friends.

Think about what you can tell your grandchildren.

“I was there when we changed the world.”
