We might not even know that other people feel the same way. That’s why we are putting language to ideas that we didn’t know we had permission to say in public, because it might threaten our sense of stability, comfort, and safety by questioning the self-appointed authorities of the social, economic, and political order.\n\nMaybe we are all sensing the same restlessness and unease with a world that says one thing but does the opposite. Enough with the political, brand, and spiritual promises that don’t fulfill the expectations of a world that is done with the exploitation of oppressive corporations.\n\nWe have sensed that the world is not the way it should be, but we can imagine a better world. So we are investing our time, energy, and resources to reimagine our social architecture. We are exploring how we imagine, design, and build the future together."}
