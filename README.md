# Builders Collective

Exploring how we can imagine, design, and build the future together. We are documenting the work of a creative collaborative community with a focus on reimagining, redesigning, and rebuilding our social architecture.

---

This repository is for a site to document the process of imagining, designing, and building the elements, components, tools, and systems that we are using to help build a community. We welcome anyone who is interested in the [vision](http://docs.bldrs.co/vision/) or who would like to engage in [the process](http://docs.bldrs.co/process/) to build this [community](http://docs.bldrs.co/community) to please get involved.
