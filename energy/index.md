# Energy

## Biological organisms require energy to sustain complex living systems

In Canada, we live in a country that is built on over 500 years of land appropriation and resource extraction for European settlers. An enormous amount of energy has been invested in populating territory that was a complex and interdependent ecosystem, and the home to Indigenous Peoples for thousands of years.

> “But when I say that Canada is fake, I don’t mean anything so universal or theoretical. Canada is not an accident or a work in progress or a thought experiment. I mean that Canada is a scam — a pyramid scheme, a ruse, a heist. Canada is a front. And it’s a front for a massive network of resource extraction companies, oil barons, and mining magnates.”
