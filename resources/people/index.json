In the logic of market valuation, humans are a liability in economic analyses that associate employees primarily with the debits accrued in the payment of salaries and benefits.\n\n## Market Economics\n\nAccording to market economics, the logic that controls our behaviours in Western Civilization, humans are worth little more than the material elements of which they are composed.\n\n> “Summing up all the amounts in the Value column, we come to a grand total of just over $160.”\n\n- [What is your body worth?](http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/april12011/)\n\n\n|            | Element    | Percentage |\n|------------|------------|------------|\n| O          | Oxygen     | 65         |\n| C          | Carbon     | 18         |\n| H          | Hydrogen   | 10.2       |\n| N          | Nitrogen   | 3.1        |\n| Ca         | Calcium    | 1.6        |\n| P          | Phosphorus | 1.2        |\n| K          | Potassium  | 0.25       |\n| S          | Sulfur     | 0.25       |\n| Na         | Sodium     | 0.15       |\n| Cl         | Chlorine   | 0.15       |\n| Mg         | Magnesium  | 0.05       |\n| Fe         | Iron       | 6.00E-03   |\n| F          | Fluorine   | 3.70E-03   |\n| Zn         | Zinc       | 3.20E-03   |\n| Si         | Silicon    | 2.00E-03   |\n| Rb         | Rubidium   | 4.60E-04   |\n| Sr         | Strontium  | 4.60E-04   |\n| Br         | Bromine    | 2.90E-04   |\n| Pb         | Lead       | 1.70E-04   |\n| Cu         | Copper     | 1.00E-04   |\n| Al         | Aluminium  | 8.70E-05   |\n| Cd         | Cadmium    | 7.20E-05   |\n| Ce         | Cerium     | 5.00E-05   |\n| Ba         | Barium     | 3.10E-05   |\n| Sn         | Tin        | 2.40E-05   |\n| I          | Iodine     | 1.60E-05   |\n| Ti         | Titanium   | 1.30E-05   |\n| B          | Boron      | 6.90E-05   |\n| Se         | Selenium   | 1.90E-05   |\n| Ni         | Nickel     | 1.40E-05   |\n| Cr         | Chromium   | 2.40E-06   |\n| Mn         | Manganese  | 1.70E-05   |\n| As         | Arsenic    | 2.60E-05   |\n| Li         | Lithium    | 3.10E-06   |\n| Hg         | Mercury    | 1.90E-05   |\n| Cs         | Caesium    | 2.10E-06   |\n| Mo         | Molybdenum | 1.30E-05   |\n| Ge         | Germanium  | 1.30E-05   |\n| Co         | Cobalt     | 2.10E-06   |\n| Sb         | Antimony   | 1.10E-05   |\n| Ag         | Silver     | 1.00E-06   |\n| Nb         | Niobium    | 1.60E-04   |\n| Zr         | Zirconium  | 6.00E-04   |\n| La         | Lanthanum  | 2.00E-04   |\n| Te         | Tellurium  | 1.20E-05   |\n| Ga         | Gallium    | 1.20E-05   |\n| Y          | Yttrium    | 1.20E-05   |\n| Bi         | Bismuth    | 1.20E-05   |\n| Tl         | Thallium   | 1.40E-05   |\n| In         | Indium     | 1.40E-05   |\n| Au         | Gold       | 1.40E-05   |\n| Sc         | Scandium   | 1.40E-05   |\n| Ta         | Tantalum   | 1.40E-05   |\n| V          | Vanadium   | 2.60E-05   |\n| Th         | Thorium    | 2.00E-07   |\n| U          | Uranium    | 1.30E-07   |\n| Sm         | Samarium   | 5.00E-09   |\n| W          | Tungsten   | 5.00E-09   |\n| Be         | Beryllium  | 5.00E-09   |\n| Ra         | Radium     | 1.00E-17   |\n\n\n## Human Resources\n\nIf it is possible to extract value from childcare, systems can be set up to ensure that parents will not raise and teach their own children when that occupation can be outsourced to state-sanctioned facilities.\n\nIf it is possible to extract value from a child’s education, systems can be set up to extract resources from the governing authorities for their indoctrination into market orthodoxy through standardized testing and industrial-scale sorting of aptitudes to prepare students for wage slavery in the market economy as part of their lifelong servitude as taxpayers to the corporate nation state.\n\nIf education can be privatized, banks can profit from the loans borrowed from potential future earnings to afford tuition, which in more progressive nations, is recognized as a form of student exploitation that also excludes intelligent and capable people from participation in the economic system.\n\nIf people can be replaced by systems, processes, and machines, it is more economically sustainable to reduce the corporation’s dependence on people to extract value from the trade of goods and services that depend largely on the appropriation of land from the Indigenous Peoples of any particular territory."}
