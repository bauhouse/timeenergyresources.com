We use technology to solve problems, but these solutions often have unintended side-effects that result in seemingly intractable problems.\n\nThe concept of resilience begins with an assumption that things break, that things will go wrong, that conflicts and problems will arise. In response to this reality, we need to create ways of proactively addressing issues before they become intractable problems.\n\nSome of the greatest creative movements have coalesced during times of immense cultural shifts and of social, political and economic crisis. As we survey our current situation, we find the social fabric being torn apart and the institutions of government, law, media,  business, and education being threatened by the inability to quickly adapt to the changes that we ourselves are bringing about either intentionally or inadvertently.\n\nWe need people who can lead our society in a different direction, against the inertia of the status quo. This is a different kind of leadership that arises from the recognition that every individual has the ability to offer their time, energy, and resources to the effort.\n\nA century ago, a great war came to an end and people came together to try to rebuild society. It was an opportunity to envision something entirely new, a modern society built on the fusion of art, technology, and industry. Craftspeople, artists and architects gathered to reimagine the forms and structures of human society. By considering basic human needs of food, clothing, and shelter, they innovated a conception of the modern dwelling: how to build a house. From the hands of millions of workers has arisen the crystal symbol of a new faith, but with the destruction of that concrete, steel and glass symbol, disillusionment has engulfed the world, bringing into question all that has been accomplished.\n\nIt brings to mind an ancient myth about people of one language who came together to build a tower, but their language was confused and the people were scattered across the earth.\n\n## What are we building?\n\nThe question we are asking ourselves is whether all the time, energy, and resources that have been invested has been worth the effort if most of the profit is accumulated by a select few and at the expense of the natural world on which our lives depend. Have we architected the means of our own demise, socially, politically, economically and ecologically?\n\n## Reimagining our social architecture\n\nGiven the challenge our generation faces, we endeavour to invest time, energy and resources in the effort of building leaders to design a resilient society. By considering basic human needs of food, clothing, and shelter, we will innovate a conception of the modern dwelling: how to build a house. The difference now is greater self-awareness, a recognition of how things can go very wrong, and the technological means to create virtual models with predictive power to anticipate problems before they become reality. This is a collaborative project to better understand ourselves and our place in this world, to find generative ways to live with each other and the natural world.\n\nTranscending human-centered design, this is design that seeks to learn from nature, to put into practice the knowledge and principles of biomimicry to reimagine and redesign our environment, to reconnect ourselves to our own humanity and to reconnect us to the earth and all living things."},{"url":"/getting-started/","title":"Getting Started","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Builders Collective","url":"/"},{"title":"Getting Started","url":"/getting-started/"}],"content":"\n# Design for Resilience\n\n## We Are All Designers\n\nAs humans, we are makers. We wield tools to transform our environment. We have collectively designed global systems of social, economic, and political power by our labour and participation in the ideas, work, and the processes, tools, machines, infrastructure, and architecture that enable these systems and activities.\n\nHowever, after working intensively for the past century, based on a modern idea of progress that values efficiency and productivity as a means of creating continuous and limitless economic growth, we have set in motion systems that are resulting in the destruction of the biological support systems on which our lives and those of so many other creatures depend.\n\n## Slowing Down to Think\n\nGiven the unintended consequences of the social architecture that we have imagined, designed, and built, we recognize that there is a need to slow down to think about the values that are driving our work. We are finding that we have designed our lives in such a way that we are serving our corporations and our machines more than we are serving the needs of humans. We are serving abstract ideas and inanimate objects while destroying life.\n\n## The Design Process\n\nThe process of design has proven to be extremely effective in creating the modern world. We have discovered the tools to radically transform the physical environment. At the same time, we have fundamentally transformed ourselves as human beings, both for good and for ill.\n\nOver the past century, we have focused on building our physical infrastructure, creating a social architecture that has solidified habits of thought, work, and social organization into forms that further entrench patterns of behaviour in social, economic, and political systems that are ultimately self-destructive.\n\nThis is a moment of realization and awareness that is motivating people to respond in anxiety, grief, and anger toward the grave circumstances in which we find ourselves. However, this is not the end of the story. We also have the means and ability to change the way we live. We can recognize the vast opportunities that this world affords and imagine the possibilities, research and define the challenges to be solved, design solutions to meet these needs, and build the kind of future in which we might all want to live.\n\nLet us now focus on the metaphysical—that which is beyond the physical: the social, economic, and political. We tend to lack the language to converse about the metaphysical, since the modern approach to social communication focuses on advertising and marketing to maintain our economic system, and, as a result, tends to create a monopoly on the mode of public and civic discourse.\n\nHowever, the technology of the modern world also gives us the means to shift the focus toward more democratic and equitable modes of conversation and engagement. Our ability to share ideas, resources, and efforts has been amplified by our technologies. We must begin with common values and the common good to redirect our time, energy, and resources into the work of reimagining, redesigning, and rebuilding our social architecture."},{"url":"/imagine/","title":"Imagine","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Builders Collective","url":"/"},{"title":"Imagine","url":"/imagine/"}],"content":"\n# Imagine\n\n## The Power of Imagination\n\nThe big picture thinking that we need to solve the greatest challenges that we are facing at this moment in time.\n\n“There is a terrible misconception in school that when we take art that we are teaching people to draw. What we are really doing is teaching people to see. That’s the important function. That’s why I think it is tragic when school funding gets cut, they cut out the art. To be creative, we must choose something that is really hard, that we might fail at, and have failed at; then we’re more likely to come up with something that is fresh and different.”\n\n— Ed Catmull, Pixar, [Creativity, Inc.](https://medium.com/imaginaxiom/art-science-7f076db69e12)\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZrjusPeOZRk\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"},{"url":"/getting-started/design-brief/","title":"Design Brief","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Builders Collective","url":"/"},{"title":"Getting Started","url":"/getting-started/"},{"title":"Design Brief","url":"/getting-started/design-brief/"}],"content":"# A Design Brief\n\n## Builders Collective\n\n*Exploring how we can imagine, design, and build the future together.*\n\n## Scope and Focus\n\nThe scope of this project is to imagine, design and build a platform for documenting the work of a collaborative creative community with a focus on reimagining, redesigning, and rebuilding our social architecture. The focus is on building a community rather than a physical artifact, in keeping with the vision to build leaders to design a resilient society. We start by building the resilience of individuals, developing healthy communities, with the vision of transforming society. The model is to create events to generate awareness and explore the possibilities of human imagination, to run workshops to engage people in participatory design, and to commit to projects to effectively collaborate together to build an inclusive, sustainable, and just way of relating to the living systems that we are a part of.\n\n## Project Background\n\nHow might we think about the big picture of how people can participate in the design of our physical world in a way that recognizes the challenges of living in a metaphysical world of social, economic, and political relationships? In the past, these relationships have had a tendency to devolve into systems of abuse, exploitation, and domination. By recognizing how things can go wrong, we can learn from the wisdom of the past to avoid making the same mistakes, we can imagine new models of social, economic, and political organization to make the present models obsolete, and we can participate in the restoration of the living ecosystems of the earth to create a future of inclusivity, well-being, and justice for the generations to come and for all living things.\n\n## High-Level Design Goals and Objectives\n\n- Build a visual design system, prototype and design experiences, and envision service design opportunities and processes for the builders collective that can work across a variety of media, channels, and touchpoints to invite people to build personal resilience, to build resilient communities, and to build a resilient society.\n- Research the opportunities to build networks of co-creation and collaboration by creating a platform to document what people are learning, how they are connecting, and why they are engaging in the work of social transformation.\n- Launch a platform which may include  a podcast, a magazine, and a website to promote events, workshops, and projects focused on the subject of resilience.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- A prototype for Resilience magazine\n- Websites for Social Architecture, Design Influences, and Builders Collective\n\t- socialarc.com\n\t- designinfluences.com\n\t- builderscollective.com\n- A podcast for the builders collective about resilience\n- An app design for creating habits of resilience, empathy, and harmony: Minimalist Journal\n\n## Brand Message\n\n- BLDRS: Building leaders to design a resilient society\n- Imagine — Social Architecture: Reimagining our common life together.\n- Design — Design influences: Inspired by the past.

To solve systemic problems, we need to be able to reimagine our social architecture, the metaphysical design of our common social, economic, and political lives on Earth and how our activity impacts the ecology of the planet and all living things?\n\nScientists have been warning us about the ecological impact of human activity for several decades. Many of us are living in denial. Children are protesting that we are leaving them a world that is on fire and we are the arsonists.\n\nOur social, economic, and political institutions are failing us.\n\n- Belief systems are dividing us\n- Corporations are exploiting us\n- Governments are oppressing us\n\nThis is a service design problem because of the many complex layers of experience, all the living organisms on the Earth who have a stake in the ecology of the planet, and the challenges we face because of the constraints on time, energy, and matter.\n\n### Doing, Not Talking\n\n> Opinions are great, and everyone always has at least one. But service design is based in reality. Instead of talking about something for a long time, build stuff, test it, understand what needs to be improved, build it again. Show me, don’t tell me. Stop comparing opinions, start testing prototypes.\n\n*Stickdorn, Marc,Hormess, Markus Edgar,Lawrence, Adam,Schneider, Jakob. This Is Service Design Doing (Kindle Locations 839-841). O'Reilly Media.

According to Astra Taylor, we need only a small percentage of motivated people to make social change a reality.\n\nWe are all in this together. (Forget demographics. It is inherently classist, racist, and sexist. Advertising and marketing are what got us into this mess.)\n\n## Methodologies\n\n- **Literature Review:** to better understand the primary challenges humans are facing.\n- **Collaborative Analysis:** to gain greater awareness of how we can build on the efforts of others.\n- **Surveys:** to discover how people are engaging in efforts to change their habits.\n- **1:1 Interviews:** to discover whether the model we are proposing for events, workshops, and projects might be effective to build relationships, capacity, and imagination.\n\n## Timeline\n\n- Literature Review\n- Collaborative Analysis\n- Surveys\n- 1:1 Interviews\n\n---\n\n<div align=\"right\">\n  <h3><a href=\"/getting-started/survey/\">Survey →</a></h3>\n</div>"},{"url":"/getting-started/survey/","title":"Survey","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Builders Collective","url":"/"},{"title":"Getting Started","url":"/getting-started/"},{"title":"Survey","url":"/getting-started/survey/"}],"content":"# A Survey\n\n## Building Resilience\n\nExploring how we imagine, design, and build the future together.
