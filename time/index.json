{"title":"Time","content":"\n# Time\n\n## Past, Present, and Future\n\nWe remember the past, experience the present, and anticipate the future. Our perception of reality is only as good as our memory of the past. If we donâ€™t remember the past, we will continue to make the same mistakes. The scientific method puts this concept into practice. If we perform the same experiment, we should consistently expect the same results.\n\n## Our histories are our collective memory\n\nHow do we know who we are except in community with other people? When we allow our identity formed only by those who we consider similar to ourselves, our identity is impoverished by the lack of awareness, knowledge, and wisdom that comes with a lack of diversity in our social relationships."}
