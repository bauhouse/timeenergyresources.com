# A Survey

## Building Resilience

Exploring how we imagine, design, and build the future together. How can we build personal resilience, resilient communities, and a resilient society?

Feel free to answer these questions from your own perspective or about people that you know.

- What are people doing to become more aware of the impact of human activity on the living systems of the Earth?
- What are people doing to maintain their mental health and resilience?
- How are people engaging in efforts to change their habits?
- How might people overcome resistance to change?
- Do you know anyone who is working to make changes and solve problems regarding resilience, mental health, or living ecosystems?
- How might art, music, storytelling, and culture be part of the solution to inspire people to work together for the common good?
