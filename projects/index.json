They are opportunities to fully engage in the process of creative collaboration to reimagine our social architecture.**\n\nPrototyping leads to a virtual storage room of digital experiences that are intended to test concepts and discover approaches that resonate with people and lead to authentic human connections. Working together can build the social bonds and networks that help us become stronger, more capable people.\n\nSetting limits and constraints helps us to bring clarity to our motivations and focuses on time, energy, and resources on the most important challenges that we face.\n\nMany of these projects need to be culled and decommissioned, but they continue to exist as records of a long process to discover the ideas that resonate with people. It has been necessary to build influence, agency, and capacity over time to be ready to fully engage in connecting a diverse community of collaborators.\n\n### PHP Server\n\n- [Bauhouse Design](http://001.bauhouse.ca/)\n- [The Design Administration](http://designadmin.com/)\n- [DesignProjectX](http://designprojectx.com/)\n- [Design Influences](https://v1.designinfluences.com/)\n- [Imaginaxiom](http://imaginaxiom.com/)\n- [Markup Library](https://markuplibrary.org/)\n- [The Lab](http://001.stephenbau.com/)\n\n### Node Server\n\n- [The Changelog](https://stephenbau.com/)\n- [The Changelog: Archive](https://log.stephenbau.com/)\n- [Builders Collective](https://builderscollective.com/)\n- [Social Architecture](https://socialarc.com/)\n- [Minimalist Journal: Dev](dev.minjour.com/)\n\n## GitHub Pages\n\n- [BLDRS Collective](https://bldrs.co/)\n- [Builders Collective: Documentation](http://docs.bldrs.co/)\n- [Minimalist Journal](https://minjour.com/)\n- [Time, Energy, and Resources](https://timeenergyresources.com/)\n\n## Stackbit Sites\n\n- [Stephen Bau, UX Designer](https://bauhouse.ca/)\n- [BauType](https://bautype.com/)\n- [Three: progress and the evolution of ideas](https://threeprogress.com/)\n- [Stephen Bau: Lab](https://lab.stephenbau.com/)\n- [Straiton Village](https://www.straitonvillage.com/)\n- [Folksonomy for Treaty People](https://2rowflow-71c9f.netlify.com/)\n\n### JAMstack Templates\n\n- [Stackbit Dashboard](https://app.stackbit.com/dashboard)\n- [Stackbit Exto Portfolio Theme](https://three-69479.netlify.com/)\n- [Stackbit Libris Theme + Sanity](https://designinfluences-5c393.netlify.com/)\n- [Stackbit Libris Theme + DatoCMS](https://design-influences-0df41.netlify.com/)\n- [De-Unicorn-ification](https://jamstack-892cf.netlify.com/)\n- [Stackbit Ampersand Theme](https://designadmin-87c6d.netlify.com/)\n- [Stackbit Ampersand Theme: Netlify CMS](https://timeenergyresource-aaa6f.netlify.com/)"}
